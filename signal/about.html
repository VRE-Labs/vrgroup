            <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Mission & Vision</h2>

                Our <strong>mission</strong> is to build a talent-focused network rooted in support, visibility, and creative freedom. We aim to give creators the tools, guidance, and exposure they need to thrive while staying true to their voice.
                <br><br>

Signal by VRE wants to redefine what it means to be part of a creative collective‚Äîwhere no one is boxed in, no one is left behind, and everyone‚Äôs signal is heard.

            <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Core Values & Aesthetic</h2>
            <p>
                We are unapologetically vibrant, community-driven, and creator-first. At Signal, our core values include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> We never ask our talent to conform or water themselves down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equity:</strong> We create a level playing field, with equal opportunities for all kinds of creators.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expression:</strong> We empower ideas that are loud, bold, weird, beautiful, raw, and real.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We‚Äôre stronger when we build together.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Aesthetically, Signal draws inspiration from cyberpunk, synthwave, arcades, and glitchcore‚Äîblending nostalgia and futuretech into one cohesive vibe. Neon visuals. Lo-fi beats. Broadcast overlays. Signal is what happens when vaporwave meets vision.

                    <li>üåê We don‚Äôt demand contracts that restrict freedom or ownership of your persona.</li>
                    <li>üì£ We offer promo, platforming, and branding guidance‚Äînot control.</li>
                    <li>üéÆ We embrace alt-culture, queer identity, neurodiversity, and rebellion as a feature‚Äînot a bug.</li>
                    <li>üõ† We provide real tools: marketing kits, community support, technical help, stream overlays, and creative assets to enhance your impact.</li>
                </ul>
