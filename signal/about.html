            <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">What is Signal by VRE?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Signal by VRE</strong> is the official creator initiative by the <em>Virtual Reality Empire</em> (VRE), dedicated to spotlighting and elevating diverse voices in the digital performance space. We represent VTubers, livestreamers, content creators, voice actors, and digital hosts from all walks of life.  
                <br><br>
                Think of Signal as a beacon—a frequency where raw creativity meets polished opportunity. Whether it’s debuting a new VTuber, launching a mini-series, or spotlighting the next iconic voice in gaming media, Signal is the platform that broadcasts bold expression without compromise.

            <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Mission & Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Our <strong>mission</strong> is to build a talent-focused network rooted in support, visibility, and creative freedom. We aim to give creators the tools, guidance, and exposure they need to thrive while staying true to their voice.
                <br><br>
                Our <strong>vision</strong> is a world where digital creators no longer have to choose between passion and sustainability. Signal by VRE wants to redefine what it means to be part of a creative collective—where no one is boxed in, no one is left behind, and everyone’s signal is heard.

            <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Core Values & Aesthetic</h2>
            <p>
                We are unapologetically vibrant, community-driven, and creator-first. At Signal, our core values include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> We never ask our talent to conform or water themselves down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equity:</strong> We create a level playing field, with equal opportunities for all kinds of creators.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expression:</strong> We empower ideas that are loud, bold, weird, beautiful, raw, and real.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We’re stronger when we build together.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Aesthetically, Signal draws inspiration from cyberpunk, synthwave, arcades, and glitchcore—blending nostalgia and futuretech into one cohesive vibe. Neon visuals. Lo-fi beats. Broadcast overlays. Signal is what happens when vaporwave meets vision.

            <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">What Makes Us Different?</h2>
            <p>
                Most agencies serve the brand. <strong>We serve the creator.</strong> At Signal by VRE:
                <ul>
                    <li>🌐 <strong>Yes, we do use contracts</strong>—but we don’t believe in one-size-fits-all deals. Every creator has different needs, and we’ll work with you to negotiate the terms <em>before</em> signing and even <em>after</em> if something no longer works for you.</li>
                    <li>📝 <strong>Contracts are for protection, not control.</strong> They outline mutual respect, shared expectations, and our commitment to supporting you—not to chain you down. If something doesn’t feel right, let’s talk. As long as it’s not one of our hard boundaries, we’re open to amending terms.</li>
                    <li>📣 We offer promo, platforming, and branding guidance—not command or censorship.</li>
                    <li>🎮 We embrace alt-culture, queer identity, neurodiversity, and rebellion as a feature—not a bug.</li>
                    <li>🛠 We provide real tools: marketing kits, community support, technical help, stream overlays, and creative assets to enhance your impact.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                You’re not here to be molded. You’re here to be launched.
