                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Effective moderation is crucial for maintaining a positive and enjoyable environment for all users. Both Discord and VRChat provide built-in moderation tools to help you manage and keep your communities safe and friendly. This document will guide you on how and when to use moderation tools in both platforms, specifically focusing on the seamless integration of Volt, our custom Discord bot, and VRChatâ€™s built-in moderation features.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">I. Moderation Tools in Discord</h2>
                <h3 class="highlight">Volt â€“ Our Custom Discord Bot</h3>
                <p>Volt is designed to enhance your moderation capabilities in Discord by automating and streamlining common tasks. Volt includes features like automated warnings, role management, message filtering, and more. Below is an overview of Voltâ€™s key moderation tools:</p>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>Automated Warnings:</strong> Volt can issue warnings to users for violating server rules. After a set number of warnings, Volt can automatically apply temporary or permanent mutes, kicks, or bans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Message Filtering:</strong> Volt can detect and block inappropriate language, spam, or specific words, reducing the need for manual intervention.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Reports:</strong> Volt allows users to report suspicious or disruptive behavior, which can trigger an alert to moderators for further review.</li>
                    <li><strong>Role-based Permissions:</strong> Volt can assign roles with specific permissions to users, giving moderators access to advanced moderation features like kicking or banning users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Volt maintains a log of all moderation actions for transparency and accountability. This log helps ensure that actions are taken fairly and in accordance with server rules.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="highlight">When to Use Discord Moderation Tools</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>Spam and Advertisements:</strong> If a user is spamming messages or advertising products/services without permission, Voltâ€™s message filtering and automated warnings can help mitigate this behavior. If necessary, Volt can also mute or ban the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Harassment and Toxicity:</strong> If a user is engaging in toxic behavior, such as bullying or harassment, Volt can issue warnings or apply mutes. Severe cases may require a ban.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule Violations:</strong> If a user repeatedly violates server rules, Volt can be configured to issue escalating warnings, which can result in temporary mutes, kicks, or permanent bans.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">II. Moderation Tools in VRChat</h2>
                <p>VRChat offers its own built-in moderation tools designed to ensure users can manage instances and groups effectively. These tools allow you to take quick action when disruptive behavior arises.</p>
                <h3 class="highlight">VRChat Moderation Tools</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>Force Mute:</strong> If a user is causing disruption through voice chat, you can forcefully mute them. This ensures that they cannot continue to disturb others, and it can be a first step in addressing inappropriate behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warnings:</strong> VRChat has a built-in Warning button. While we encourage verbal warnings as a first resort, it may become necessary to escalate to a physical warning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kick from Instance:</strong> If a user is being disruptive but their actions are not severe enough to warrant a ban, you can kick them from the instance. This removes them temporarily and prevents further disruption within that specific session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ban from Group:</strong> If a user continues to cause problems and is not responding to warnings or kicks, you can ban them from the group or instance. This is a more serious action and should be used in cases of repeated violations or severe disruption.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="highlight">When to Use VRChat Moderation Tools</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>Voice Disturbance:</strong> If a user is repeatedly interrupting or speaking inappropriately, use the Force Mute feature to stop the disruption. This is especially important in VRChat where voice communication is key to the experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minor Disruptions:</strong> For less severe disturbances, such as inappropriate behavior or actions that donâ€™t violate community guidelines directly, a kick from the instance can be effective. This gives the user a chance to adjust their behavior without being permanently banned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Severe Violations:</strong> If a userâ€™s actions are damaging to the communityâ€”such as harassment, hate speech, or serious rule-breakingâ€”it may be necessary to ban them from the group. Bans should be considered as a last resort after attempting less severe actions, like warnings and kicks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">III. Best Practices for Moderation</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>Be Fair and Consistent:</strong> Moderators should always apply the rules consistently. Ensure that the same guidelines are followed for all users, regardless of their status or relationships with staff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Escalating Measures:</strong> Start with a warning or a less severe action (such as a mute or kick), and escalate the severity of the punishment only if the behavior continues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate with Users:</strong> Whenever possible, communicate with users before taking action. Let them know why their behavior is inappropriate, and give them a chance to correct it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep Records:</strong> In Discord, Volt logs all actions taken by moderators, which is crucial for transparency and accountability. In VRChat, while actions like kicks and bans may be recorded, it's also helpful to document any user interactions for future reference in case of disputes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Abuse of Power:</strong> Moderators should avoid using their power for personal gain or to settle personal conflicts. Always use moderation tools to protect the community and ensure a positive experience for everyone.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Both Discord and VRChat provide robust moderation tools to help maintain a safe and enjoyable experience for all users. By using Volt, our custom Discord bot, along with the built-in tools provided by VRChat, you can effectively manage your community and handle disruptive behavior. Remember to always apply moderation actions fairly, escalate when necessary, and communicate with users to ensure a positive environment.</p>
