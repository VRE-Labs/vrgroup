                <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                <p>A Progress Performance Improvement Plan (PPIP) is a structured approach designed to enhance the effectiveness of event planning, execution, and moderation. PPIPs are used to identify performance gaps, provide actionable feedback, and set clear goals for improvement. This ensures that VREvents maintains a high standard of quality and professionalism in all hosted events.</p>
