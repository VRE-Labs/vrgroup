                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Proactive Behavioral Correction (PBC) is a strategy designed to address behavioral issues before they escalate. Instead of waiting for someone to break the rules, we step in early to guide them in the right direction. This helps keep VREvents fun, respectful, and fair for everyone while avoiding unnecessary punishments.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Ideas of PBC</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>Step In Early</strong> ‚Äì Address small problems before they turn into big ones. For example, if someone keeps interrupting others, gently remind them to let everyone have a chance to speak before it becomes a larger issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Calm and Respectful</strong> ‚Äì Use a neutral, friendly tone when correcting someone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Guide, Don‚Äôt Punish Right Away</strong> ‚Äì Help people improve their behavior rather than jumping to consequences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Fair and Consistent</strong> ‚Äì Treat everyone equally when applying rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Fixing small issues early helps keep the whole community running smoothly.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">2Ô∏è‚É£ Signs of Problem Behavior</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>Talking Over Others</strong> ‚Äì Not letting other people speak or ignoring event hosts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rude or Passive-Aggressive Comments</strong> ‚Äì Saying things that are subtly mean or create tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disrupting Events</strong> ‚Äì Constantly changing the topic, spamming, or using distracting avatars (e.g., avatars with excessive visual effects, loud sound effects, or those that obscure other participants).</li>
                    <li><strong>Early Signs of Toxic Behavior</strong> ‚Äì Excluding people, making fun of others, or acting hostile.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you catch these behaviors early, you can prevent them from escalating into bigger issues.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">3Ô∏è‚É£ Three Steps to Correct Behavior</h2>
                <h3 class="highlight">üîπ Step 1: Friendly Reminder</h3>
                <p>Gently call out the behavior in a casual way.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> "Hey [User], let‚Äôs make sure everyone gets a turn to speak. Thanks!"</p>
                <p>Most people will adjust if they get a small reminder.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">üîπ Step 2: Direct but Polite Warning</h3>
                <p>If the issue continues, be firmer but still respectful.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> "[User], please follow the event rules. Repeated disruptions might lead to further action."</p>
                <p>Make sure they understand why the behavior isn‚Äôt okay.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">üîπ Step 3: Official Warning or Action</h3>
                <p>If the person still doesn‚Äôt listen, issue an official warning and log it.</p>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li>If needed, use timeouts, mutes, or kicks to keep the event running smoothly.</li>
                    <li>Let higher-level moderators know if the problem continues.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This method keeps corrections fair while ensuring the community stays positive.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">4Ô∏è‚É£ When to Take Stronger Action</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
                    <li><strong>If someone ignores multiple warnings</strong> or keeps causing issues, report them to an Events Mod or Lead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serious offenses</strong> (harassment, threats, hate speech) should be dealt with immediately‚Äîmute, timeout, or remove them.</li>
                    <li>Use the <strong>Volt Moderation Control Panel</strong> to handle situations quickly and effectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We try to correct behavior first, but when necessary, we enforce the rules quickly and fairly.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Proactive Behavioral Correction ensures that moderators maintain a positive and respectful environment by addressing issues early and fairly. By stepping in early, using a calm and respectful tone, and guiding users instead of punishing them outright, we create a better experience for everyone.</p>
                <p>Recognizing problem behaviors, following the three-step correction process, and knowing when to escalate issues are all key to successful moderation.</p>
                <p>Using this approach helps make VREvents a welcoming and enjoyable place for all participants. Our goal is to guide individuals toward better behavior while enforcing community standards when necessary.</p>
                <p><strong>üõ† All moderators should practice these techniques to handle situations smoothly and fairly.</strong></p>
