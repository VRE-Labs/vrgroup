                <h2 class="section-title">🛠️ Initiative Overview</h2>
                <p>The New Member Retention Initiative is designed to increase community engagement and retention by ensuring new members feel welcomed, valued, and supported from the moment they join. As staff, you play a critical role in fostering a positive first impression.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">🚀 Key Initiative Changes</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>✅ Welcome Messages Moved to General Chat:</strong> This allows for more organic interactions rather than automated messages being ignored.</li>
                    <li><strong>✅ Staff Are Expected to Actively Welcome New Members:</strong> A friendly greeting can make all the difference in someone choosing to stay.</li>
                    <li><strong>✅ Encouraging and Helpful Interactions Are Required:</strong> Answering questions and guiding new members contributes to a welcoming environment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">📌 Staff Expectations & Best Practices</h2>
                <h3 class="highlight">🔹 1. Welcoming New Members</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>✔️ Acknowledge:</strong> Greet every new member in #general-chat shortly after they join.</li>
                    <li><strong>✔️ Use Friendly Greetings:</strong> For example, “Welcome to the server, [username]! We’re happy to have you here! 😊”.</li>
                    <li><strong>✔️ Respect Their Space:</strong> If they don’t respond right away, don’t pressure them—some people are shy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="highlight">🔹 2. Encouraging Engagement</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>✔️ Ask Open-Ended Questions:</strong> For example, "What brings you to VRChat?" or "Are you excited for upcoming events?".</li>
                    <li><strong>✔️ Suggest Activities:</strong> If they seem hesitant, recommend fun activities or direct them to event announcements.</li>
                    <li><strong>✔️ Offer Support:</strong> Let them know they can DM staff or ask in chat if they have any questions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="highlight">🔹 3. Handling Questions & Concerns</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>✔️ Be Helpful and Patient:</strong> Even if the question has been asked 100 times, answer it kindly.</li>
                    <li><strong>✔️ Escalate When Necessary:</strong> If you don’t know the answer, direct them to someone who does instead of brushing them off.</li>
                    <li><strong>✔️ Assist with Issues:</strong> Help new members with verification or roles, or escalate it to an officer if needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">🚨 Consequences for Negligence</h2>
                <p>We are committed to maintaining a high standard of engagement. Staff found to be:</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>❌ Lazy:</strong> Ignoring new members.</li>
                    <li><strong>❌ Inattentive:</strong> Failing to answer basic questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>❌ Negative:</strong> Being dismissive, rude, or discouraging.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>...will be warned. Repeat offenses may result in removal from the team.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">📌 Final Notes</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Retention Starts with Us:</strong> A good first interaction can be the reason a new member stays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lead by Example:</strong> Staff members are expected to promote a welcoming, fun, and interactive atmosphere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Guidance:</strong> If you need help, reach out to an Officer or Lead for support.</li>
                </ul>
