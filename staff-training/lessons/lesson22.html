        <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">1. 🚸 Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Online spaces, especially communities like VRE that span platforms such as Discord and VRChat, can attract users of all ages. It's important to understand how to appropriately and responsibly handle interactions with children and teens to ensure the safety of the space, the legality of the platform use, and the comfort of the community.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">2. 📛 When a User Admits to Being Under 13</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
          <li><strong>Immediate Action Required:</strong> Both Discord and VRChat have a strict minimum age of 13. If a user admits to being under 13, they must be removed from the server or world immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Be Calm and Respectful:</strong> Do not shame or publicly call them out. Quietly document the admission and notify a lead or admin team to handle removal and any report filing if necessary.</li>
          <li><strong>Log and Report:</strong> Take screenshots if needed, and make sure the situation is logged internally. If necessary, report the user to the respective platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">3. 👦👧 Teens (13-17) in the Community</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
          <li><strong>Monitor Interactions:</strong> Teens are allowed by platform ToS, but staff must ensure their safety and that they are not exposed to adult or NSFW content.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourage Positive Spaces:</strong> If a conversation gets too mature, redirect the topic or gently guide participants back on track.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Appropriate Language:</strong> Always maintain professionalism when speaking to minors, even in casual environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">4. 🛠️ Tools and Protocol</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
          <li><strong>Use Soft Language for Redirection:</strong> If a teen is being disruptive or off-topic, guide them with empathy. Example: "Hey there! Let's try to keep this conversation friendly and on-topic. Thanks for understanding!"</li>
          <li><strong>Don't Assume:</strong> If you suspect someone is underage but they haven’t said anything, do not confront them publicly. Monitor behavior and escalate privately to a senior staff member if necessary.</li>
          <li><strong>Channel Age Verification Protocol:</strong> Ensure that age-restricted channels are locked behind verified roles and appropriate content gating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">5. ⚖️ Maintaining Peace While Staying Compliant</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
          <li><strong>De-Escalate Calmly:</strong> If tensions rise during enforcement, always aim to de-escalate. Being firm doesn't mean being hostile.</li>
          <li><strong>Promote Vibe-Centric Moderation:</strong> If someone's behavior is immature or annoying but not breaking rules, consider soft guidance or temporary muting before harsher actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep the Community in Mind:</strong> Your actions as a mod reflect the vibe of the entire VRE brand. Lead by example and prioritize the community’s safety and enjoyment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title cyberpunk-subheading">6. 📌 Summary</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list cyberpunk-list">
          <li>Children under 13 = immediate removal and log/report.</li>
          <li>Teens must be treated with care, with a focus on creating a safe environment.</li>
          <li>All actions should be calm, respectful, and clearly documented.</li>
          <li>Always prioritize VRE’s reputation, safety, and community vibe.</li>
        </ul>
