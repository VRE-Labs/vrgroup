                <p>To maintain a safe, fair, and high-quality environment within VRE, we have developed the Staff Accountability & Improvement Process (SAIP) to address harmful and negative staff behavior.</p>
                <h3 class="highlight">Key Principles of SAIP:</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>âœ… Fair & Transparent:</strong> Every step is clearly communicated.</li>
                    <li><strong>âœ… Corrective, Not Punitive:</strong> The goal is improvement, not punishment.</li>
                    <li><strong>âœ… Consistent & Documented:</strong> Every case follows the same structured process.</li>
                    <li><strong>âœ… Confidential & Respectful:</strong> Staff concerns are handled privately and professionally.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Used for:</strong> Minor issues, misunderstandings, or occasional poor judgment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Speaking out of turn, mild negativity, small rule infractions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action Taken:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A lead/mod sits down with the staff member for a one-on-one chat.</li>
                            <li>Behavior is explained, expectations are clarified, and guidance is given.</li>
                            <li>The conversation is logged privately but does not count as a formal warning.</li>
                            <li>Staff member acknowledges the issue and commits to improvement.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>ðŸ›  Goal:</strong> Help the staff member self-correct before escalation.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">ðŸŸ¡ Tier 2 â€“ Formal Warning & Improvement Plan</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Used for:</strong> Repeated minor issues or a single moderate offense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Excessive negativity, inappropriate jokes, minor power misuse.</li>

                            <li>A 30-day Improvement Plan is created with specific goals & behavioral expectations.</li>
                            <li>Staff must check in regularly with a mentor/mod lead for progress updates.</li>
                            <li>Failure to meet improvement goals leads to Tier 3 escalation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>ðŸ›  Goal:</strong> Provide structured improvement steps while emphasizing accountability.</p>

                            <li>They must undergo additional training & supervision by leadership.</li>
                            <li>A final behavior assessment is conducted before probation ends.</li>
                            <li>If significant improvement is shown, they are reinstated with full permissions.</li>
                            <li>If no improvement is shown, they are moved to Tier 4.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
