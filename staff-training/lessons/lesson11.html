                <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
                <p>When a user is muted, they are assigned a mute role flag, which limits their access to the server and restricts their ability to interact with channels, including the verification process.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">How the Mute Role Works</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Muted Role Assignment:</strong> Muted users are automatically assigned a Muted role.</li>
                    <li><strong>Channel Restrictions:</strong> This role removes access to all channels except for #muted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication in #muted:</strong> Muted users can only communicate in #muted, where they can be contacted by staff.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Impact on Verification</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Permission Overrides:</strong> Since the muted role overrides regular permissions, muted users may not be able to complete standard verification steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification Commands:</strong> Muted users cannot access verification commands or interact with verification bots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manual Review:</strong> Staff must manually review muted users to determine if they should be unmuted or remain restricted.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Communicating with Muted Users</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Use #muted:</strong> Muted users are expected to respond in #muted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff Communication:</strong> Staff should use this channel to ask for clarification regarding why the mute was triggered and what steps the user needs to take.</li>
                    <li><strong>Response Timeframe:</strong> Users who fail to respond within a set timeframe (6-12 hours) may be subject to further action, such as removal from the server.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Resolving a Mute</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>User Explanation:</strong> The muted user should explain their situation in #muted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff Review:</strong> A moderator or officer evaluates their response and determines whether the mute was justified.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action Taken:</strong> The mute is either removed (if deemed accidental or unjustified) or upheld (if rule violations persist).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>By maintaining a structured approach to handling mutes, we ensure that legitimate members retain access while effectively managing potential spam or disruptive behavior.</p>
