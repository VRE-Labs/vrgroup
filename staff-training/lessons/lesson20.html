                <h2 class="section-title">üß≠ Purpose of this Guide</h2>
                <p>Virtual Reality Entertainment is a nexus where immersive experiences and human connection intertwine. Our community is a sanctuary for creativity, inclusivity, and unity. However, with interpersonal connections‚Äîespecially those between users and staff‚Äîcomes the need for vigilance, fairness, and integrity. This guide exists to empower our team to handle rule violations when personal relationships are involved, with wisdom, grace, and unwavering allegiance to our code.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">üîë Core Principles</h2>
                <h3 class="highlight">Integrity Over Intimacy</h3>
                <p>Relationships do not override rules. Staff must remain impartial regardless of emotional closeness or history with a user.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">Transparency Without Betrayal</h3>
                <p>While privacy is respected, hiding violations for the sake of personal bonds betrays the trust placed in our staff by the community.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">Professionalism in Proximity</h3>
                <p>Familiarity with users must never result in favoritism. Decisions must be made as if the user were a stranger‚Äîalways with the community's well-being in mind.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">Unity Without Bias</h3>
                <p>Staff must operate as a single body, unified in decision-making. No rogue actions, no lone wolves. Every decision affects the whole.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Recognizing the Signs of Compromised Judgment</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Hesitation to act due to personal involvement.</li>
                    <li>Rationalizing harmful behavior because of emotional connection.</li>
                    <li>Fear of backlash from the individual if action is taken.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding escalation or reporting to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù the person.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If any of these apply, take a step back. Call in neutral staff. You're not weak‚Äîyou're wise.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Protocol: Handling Violations Involving Personal Connections</h2>
                <h3 class="highlight">Step 1: Recognize and Acknowledge</h3>
                <p>If a user in a personal relationship with staff violates a rule, acknowledge it openly with yourself and‚Äîif necessary‚Äîyour team. Avoid downplaying or ignoring.</p>
                <p><em>‚ÄúPersonal ties do not make public actions private.‚Äù</em></p>

                <h3 class="highlight">Step 2: Disengage and Redirect</h3>
                <p>The staff member involved in the relationship must recuse themselves from direct disciplinary actions.</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Do:</strong> Notify leadership or neutral team members.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don‚Äôt:</strong> Attempt to handle it yourself ‚Äúquietly.‚Äù</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="highlight">Step 3: Document Objectively</h3>
                <p>Use only facts. Strip emotion. Date, time, what occurred, what rule was violated. Leave out personal context.</p>
                <p><em>‚ÄúThis is about conduct, not connection.‚Äù</em></p>

                <h3 class="highlight">Step 4: Delegate Discipline</h3>
                <p>A neutral party or a council within staff leadership handles the case. Transparency is critical‚Äîdecisions must be explained both to the team and, when appropriate, to the user.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">Step 5: Debrief Internally</h3>
                <p>If tension arises between staff and user post-action, leadership must step in to support the affected team members, reinforcing morale and trust.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Relationship Guidelines for Staff</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Declare Relationships:</strong> Not to expose‚Äîjust to plan. If you are close to someone in the community, log it with leadership to avoid future conflict of interest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Enabling:</strong> Don't cover for someone you care about. Helping them means holding them accountable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Counsel:</strong> If unsure, consult another staff member or lead. Emotional entanglement clouds judgment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Special Consideration: Romantic or Intimate Bonds</h2>
                <p>This is not a place for judgment‚Äîbut for clarity.</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>If a staff member is romantically or intimately involved with a user:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>That user must not be under their moderation jurisdiction.</li>
                        <li>Any incident involving them must be escalated and removed from their purview.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Staff are encouraged to take a leave from disciplinary roles when emotionally compromised.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Final Directive: The VRE Ethos</h2>
                <p><em>‚ÄúWe are not arbiters. We are guardians. And our greatest strength lies not in who we know‚Äîbut in what we uphold.‚Äù</em></p>
                <p>Virtual Reality Entertainment thrives because it dares to be human while staying grounded in structure. Relationships make us strong. Boundaries make us unbreakable.</p>
