        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Incident Summary</h2>
        <p>The user <strong>@SuccubusLucyFb</strong> was flagged by our security screening system due to having an account less than 24 hours old. As a result, they were automatically muted and provided a chance to explain why they were using a brand-new Discord account.</p>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Response & Outcome</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>A message was sent notifying the user of their mute and requesting an explanation.</li>
            <li>The user failed to respond before the end of the day, either in the muted channel or via direct messages.</li>
            <li>As per security protocol, the user was removed from the server due to non-compliance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Assessment</h2>
        <p>This action aligns with the server’s security policies to prevent potential alt accounts, bots, or bad actors from bypassing moderation measures. Given the lack of response from the user, the removal was justified.</p>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Recommendations</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>✅ Continue enforcing security screening procedures to maintain server integrity.</li>
            <li>✅ Consider expanding response time in special cases where users may have limited availability.</li>
            <li>✅ Maintain transparency in security policies to ensure new users understand the requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Final Decision</h2>
        <p>✅ Removal upheld. No further action required.</p>
