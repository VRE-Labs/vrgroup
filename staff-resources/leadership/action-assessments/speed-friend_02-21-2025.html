        <p><strong>📅 Date:</strong> 02/21/2025</p>
        <p><strong>📍 Event:</strong> Speed Friending</p>
        <p><strong>🕒 Time Zone:</strong> Mountain Standard Time</p>
        <p><strong>📝 Assessment Conducted By:</strong> Ares</p>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">🔎 Overall Moderation Performance Assessment</h2>
        <h3>📌 Strengths Observed:</h3>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>✅ Swift Action Against Rule Violations: All reported disruptive users were immediately removed, ensuring the event remained a safe and inclusive space. No incidents escalated beyond verbal altercations.</li>
            <li>✅ Adherence to Zero-Tolerance Policy: Moderators upheld strict enforcement against harassment, hate speech, and potential threats, reinforcing community standards.</li>
            <li>✅ Effective Use of Instance Kicks & Group Bans: Moderation actions were proportionate to the offenses. The one group ban issued was in response to a potential high-risk user, demonstrating proactive risk mitigation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>⚠️ Areas for Improvement:</h3>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>❌ Insufficient Moderator Presence: The event experienced a period where only one moderator was present due to another mod crashing. While no severe disruptions occurred, this created a coverage gap that could have led to a safety risk.
                <ul>
                    <li>🔹 <strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure adherence to the 1:30 Moderator-to-User ratio by assigning backup moderators and emphasizing redundancy in case of unexpected disconnects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>❌ Unconfirmed Report Handling: While the immediate ban of RockySi709 was a necessary precaution due to minors being present, the lack of verification raises concerns about due diligence.
                <ul>
                    <li>🔹 <strong>Solution:</strong> Implement a structured review process for handling high-risk reports, possibly requiring more verification before group bans. A temporary instance kick followed by rapid escalation to leads may be a better approach.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">📊 Final Rating</h2>
        <p><strong>Moderation Performance:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
        <p><strong>🔹 What Went Well:</strong> Quick, decisive actions prevented disruptions. Moderators enforced policies effectively.</p>
        <p><strong>🔹 What Needs Work:</strong> Better backup coverage, improved handling of serious but unverified reports.</p>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">🛠️ Action Plan Moving Forward</h2>
        <ol class="styled-list">
            <li>1️⃣ Reinforce 1:30 Mod-to-User Ratio Compliance: Ensure there are at least two active moderators at all times, with an on-call backup.</li>
            <li>2️⃣ Enhance Crash Contingency Plans: If a moderator crashes, a backup must immediately step in.</li>
            <li>3️⃣ Refine Protocol for Unconfirmed Reports: Consider temporary removals before permanent bans, except in cases of imminent risk.</li>
            <li>4️⃣ Review & Debrief: Gather moderator feedback and adjust protocols for future events.</li>
        </ol>
