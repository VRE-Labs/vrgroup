        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Assessment of Actions Taken</h2>
        <h3>Initial Mute & Warning (Grade: A-)</h3>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>The initial mute and warning message was clear, concise, and firm, effectively explaining the rule violation and potential consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Room for Improvement:</strong> The message could have included a reference to the rule number or a link to server guidelines to reinforce the authority of the action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Follow-Up & Time Adjustment (Grade: B)</h3>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>Proactively monitoring the user's online status and attempting to prompt engagement was appropriate and assertive.</li>
            <li><strong>Room for Improvement:</strong> Reducing the timer from 1 hour to 5 minutes might have been perceived as overly aggressive. While the user was online, there was no evidence they had seen the message. A slightly longer grace period (e.g., 15-20 minutes) would have been more reasonable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Ban Execution (Grade: B+)</h3>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>The ban was justified, given the rule violation and non-cooperation.</li>
            <li>The message explaining the ban was direct and clearly outlined the reasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Room for Improvement:</strong> The ban message could have been more neutral in tone—phrases like “clearly have no intention to contribute” may come across as assumptive rather than factual. Instead, a more professional approach like:
                <blockquote>"Due to repeated violations and lack of response to staff intervention, your access to this community has been revoked."</blockquote>
                would have sufficed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Progress Performance Improvement Plan (PPIP)</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Improve the effectiveness of moderation actions while maintaining fairness and professionalism.</p>
        <h3>Key Improvements for Future Cases:</h3>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>✅ Use Structured Timelines: Maintain a standard timeframe for muted users to respond (e.g., 30 minutes minimum, with a possible extension based on activity).</li>
            <li>✅ Avoid Assumptive Language: Ensure ban messages remain neutral and fact-based, avoiding emotional or speculative statements.</li>
            <li>✅ Reference Server Rules: When issuing punishments, include direct references to the relevant rule number or documentation to reinforce clarity.</li>
            <li>✅ Balance Assertiveness & Fairness: While prompt action is critical, allow a reasonable opportunity for engagement before escalating to a ban.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Final Rating</h2>
        <p><strong>Moderation Response:</strong> B+ (Good execution with room for refinement in tone and response timing.)</p>
