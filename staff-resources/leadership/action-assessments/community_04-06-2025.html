        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">Incident Details</h2>
        <p><strong>Date of Initial Incident:</strong> April 5th & April 6th, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Prepared By:</strong> VRE Officers</p>
        <p><strong>Assessment Date:</strong> April 6th, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Finalized â€“ Action Executed</p>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">ðŸ”¹ Overview</h2>
        <p>On 04/05/2025, during the Board Games & Chill VR Event Night, the user <strong>BlackIceDraco(vr)/BlackIceDracon(Discord)</strong> engaged in multiple instances of behavior that directly violated VREâ€™s core principles of safety, inclusivity, and respect. Despite being a new member, their actions severely disrupted the atmosphere and compromised the wellbeing of event staff and attendees.</p>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">ðŸ”¹ Documented Violations</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li><strong>Antisemitic Jokes:</strong> Made repeated offensive jokes referencing tragic historical events, including the September 11th attacks. These remarks were made under the guise of humor within a Cards Against Humanity session but crossed into overt hate speech territory.</li>
            <li><strong>Sexual Harassment:</strong> Directed unwanted and sexualized commentary toward a Mod, objectifying them in front of peers during an event.</li>
            <li><strong>Hostile Tone with Community Members:</strong> Was repeatedly rude, dismissive, and confrontational with existing VRE members and guests.</li>
            <li><strong>Compromised Staff Functionality:</strong> Directly contributed to an unsafe work environment. All three current Events Staffâ€”two Officers and one Modâ€”expressed discomfort and refusal to participate in future events if his presence remained.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">ðŸ”¹ Attempted Re-entry via Alternate Account</h2>
        <p>Following the removal, BlackIceDracon attempted to rejoin VRE under an alternate Discord account, circumventing the ban. This confirms a deliberate lack of accountability and a further breach of trust and community standards.</p>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">ðŸ”¹ Resolution</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li><strong>Action Taken:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Permanent ban of BlackIceDracon and associated alt(s).</li>
                    <li>Incident documented and filed.</li>
                    <li>Community not formally notified to avoid drama escalation; statement prepared if transparency is later required.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Staff Accountability:</strong> One Officer voluntarily issued themselves a formal caution regarding prior comments that may have, unintentionally, contributed to the tone of the event. This models the standard we hold all members to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cyberpunk-title">ðŸ”¹ Final Remarks</h2>
        <p>The leadership of VRE remains steadfast in protecting our spaces from toxicity, discrimination, and harassmentâ€”regardless of tenure or status. This userâ€™s removal was necessary not just for the wellbeing of our staff, but for the integrity of the community itself.</p>
